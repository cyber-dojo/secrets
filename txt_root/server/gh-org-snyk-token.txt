secret-usage: Token necessary to run Snyk-scanning of docker images in GH actions.
Used by several GitHub actions in server and cli.

update-instructions:
Kosli has a free snyk account https://app.snyk.io/org/kosli-njSTUzmgmXbHkuzQC4fgu2
As a free customer we do not have access to Service accounts so we have to use
a private API key in the CI jobs.

Go to snyk account settings page
  https://app.snyk.io/account
Select <Revoke & Regenerate> It will generate a new key. We can not set an expire
date on the key it self, but set the expire to 12 month from now in this file.

Also press the <Settings> <Snyk Code> and make sure the "Enable Snyk Code" is enabled.

Since your private snyk-token has changed you also need to run this in a terminal
on your machine:
  snyk auth

Go to https://github.com/organizations/kosli-dev/settings/secrets/actions
and update the secret.
