secret-usage:
The KOSLI_API_TOKEN secret actually holds *two* Kosli api-tokens;
one for attestations to https://app.kosli.com, then a comma, then
one for attestations to https://staging.app.kosli.com
See https://github.com/kosli-dev/cli/blob/main/cmd/kosli/doubledHost.go


Update-instructions:

Go to https://app.kosli.com/cyber-dojo/settings/service-accounts
In the ci-pipelines service account, delete the API-token called 'github'.
Create a new API-token called github, with an expiry-date and description 'github'
Ensure the api-token does not contain a comma.
Make a copy of this "prod" API-token.

Go to https://staging.app.kosli.com/cyber-dojo/settings/service-accounts
In the ci-pipelines service account, delete the API-token called 'github'.
Create a new API-token called github, with the same expiry-date and description 'github'
Ensure the api-token does not contain a comma.
Make a copy of the "staging" API-token.

Prepare the secret's value which must be:
- the "prod" API-token
- a comma
- the "staging" API-token

Once again, check carefully that neither API-tokens contains a comma.
